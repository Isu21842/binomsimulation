Binomial distribution simulation

This is just a function to generate and store the summed results from multiple iterations of draws from a n sample of binomial distributions. It's inspired from a 3Blue1Brown video that performs this simulation to teach about binomial distributions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8idr1WZ1A7Q&t=529s. Around the 6:10 mark of the video, you can see how the simulation works.
