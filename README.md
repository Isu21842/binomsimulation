Binomial distribution simulation

This is just a function to generate and store the results from multiple iterations of drawing an n sample from a binomial distribution and summing them together. It's inspired by a 3Blue1Brown video that performs this simulation to teach binomial distributions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8idr1WZ1A7Q&t=529s. Around the 6:05 mark of the video, you can see how the simulation works.
